# Lightweight bazel cache server

This is a lightweight server to be used as a [Bazel remote cache](https://bazel.build/remote/caching) server on the development machine. It is inspired by Asana's [bazels3cache](https://github.com/Asana/bazels3cache). I use it as bazel cache backend when I develop on [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/).
